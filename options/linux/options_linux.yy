The player controls a ship and attempts to avoid crashing into asteroids both by maneuvering around them and blasting them into smaller pieces. This game is of mathematical interest because it takes place on a torus, meaning that objects that leave one edge \"wrap around\" to the opposite edge.\\u000d\\u000a\\u000d\\u000aThis version of the game can be played on a variety of other topological surfaces besides the torus, including: the cylinder, the MÃ¶bius strip, the sphere, the Klein Bottle, and the real projective plane. The camera can either be locked to the fundamental polygon (in which case the ship can change orientation) or follow the ship (in which case the surroundings can change orientation).",
