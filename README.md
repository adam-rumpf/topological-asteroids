# Topological Asteroids

An Asteroids-esque game that can be played on different topological spaces (in addition to the usual torus).

This is a game based on the classic arcade game [_Asteroids_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)). The player controls a ship and attempts to avoid crashing into asteroids both by maneuvering around them and blasting them into smaller pieces. This game is of mathematical interest because it takes place on a [torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus), meaning that objects that leave one edge "wrap around" to the opposite edge.

This version of the game can be played on a variety of other topological surfaces besides the torus, including: the cylinder, the [Möbius strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip), the sphere, the [Klein Bottle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_bottle), and the [real projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_plane). The camera can either be locked to the [fundamental polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_polygon) (in which case the ship can change orientation) or follow the ship (in which case the surroundings can change orientation).
